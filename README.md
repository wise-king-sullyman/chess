## How to Play

1. Download the repo and `cd` into it and run `ruby lib/main.rb` OR follow this live link and click the run button https://replit.com/@kingsullyman/chess-1
2. Follow the instructions to continue from the last saved game or start a new game
3. Follow the instructions to select a one player game against a (rudimentary) computer player, or a two human player game
4. If you select to play a one player game select whether you want to play white or black
5. To enter a move use the coordinates on the board with the letter first to select the piece you want to move, hit enter, then type where you want to move it to and hit enter again. I.e. h7 *enter* h6 *enter*
6. Do your best to win! Full movement rules are implemented including en passant and castling, but draw conditions are not currently implemented and the game will only end on checkmate
